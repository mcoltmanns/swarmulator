the instancer works! we can now support many different object types in the same simulation, all rendered on the gpu
things seem to top out at about 20k objects in the boid simulation depending on how dense stuff gets

now we just need to get the logging working all nice
and finish encapsulation of objectinstancer within simulator

logging??
hdf5
groups are like folders - can contain datasets, named datatypes, or other groups
datasets are multidimensional arrays of data elements
    - dimensions are described by dataspace
    - data elements are units of data
    - dataspace and datatype may not be changed after dataset creation

we want fast indexing on both object and timestep
we know for how long the simulation will run, and we know at which intervals we will log -> we know the number of entries on the time axis
