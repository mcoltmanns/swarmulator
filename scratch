foraging
- environment needs to be rich enough to support a stupid population, else no evolution can ever take place
- agents figure out how to clump in straight lines that circle through high-food regions very quickly (only several thousand iterations in)
- then eventually they figure out how to coalesce within those straight lines by moving out of line with the main flow until they encounter other agents
- do they ever figure out how to circle back around?
