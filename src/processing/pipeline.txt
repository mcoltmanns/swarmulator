we want to test the effects of:
- bag of words size (8, 16, 32, 64 words)
- artifact consideration interval (every 10, 100, 1_000, 10_000, 100_000 steps)
- number of past artifacts to consider (16, 32, 64, 128)

run 3 instances of each simulation
- fixed timestep 1/update
- 10 update log interval
- 10_000_000 updates
name simulation instances "<scenario>-<instance number>.h5"

for observer:
    process each instance for each bag of words size (all artifacts, no skip)
    name artifact files "<scenario>-<instance number>-<word count>.arts.h5"

    run novelty/learnability tests once on each instance, for each word size
    - once for each lookback length/artifact interval combo
    name data files "<scenario>-<instance number>-<word count>-<lookback>-<interval>.an.h5"
        - within the data files, have one group for learnability, one for novelty, one for timestamps

for degrees of change:
    will need to fit curves to certain "indicator variables" and then take derivatives of those curves
    a measure has more degrees of change if more derivatives can be taken before the derivative goes flat
    need a flatness test
    what indicator variables?
    - positions of agents in the swarm
    - density of the swarm
    - 

for genetic diversity:
    what is genetic diversity?
    full variance approach
        - variance is probably not a bad measure, but use unbiased sample variance (since we calculate the mean from the samples)
        - variance of a given component is the sum of squared deviations from the sample mean divided by n - 1
        - then you could take the mean of the variances of all the components and use that as an overall diversity score
    pca approach
        - why? read witkowski/ikegami again, but my justification would be that doing pca before taking variances lets you remove unimportant components (pathways that get shut off/outcompeted by other weights)
        - do pca, take n most important components, then do variance analysis on those
        - again the issue arises, do changes in these values actually encode the behavior of the swarm?

for signalling complexity:
